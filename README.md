# Msc-thesis
This is the result of my master thesis on Multi-Objective Optimization. This repository is more focused towards Pareto-based optimization rather than Single-Objective optimization with preference articulation. We focus on time-consuming optimization routines and, as a result we focus on model-based methods to allow for faster convergence times. This is relevant for Architectural Design Optimization, which depends on time-intensive simulations (e.g. minutes, hours or even days to complete a single simulation).
