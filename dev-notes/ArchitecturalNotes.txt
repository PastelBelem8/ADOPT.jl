OptimTestProblems associate all the logic and all the functions to the
OptimizationProblem, while creating a data structure for holding
constraint-related information, which is also associated to the
OptimizationProblem itself. There are however a few fields left to explain in
the data structure holding constraints information, namely the lc and uc
attributes.
