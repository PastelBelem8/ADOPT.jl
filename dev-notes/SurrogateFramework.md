## Surrogate Management Frameworks

Many surrogate management frameworks have been proposed. In 1998, Booker [1]
claims that existing techniques for solving simulation-based optimization
problems are not appropriate, as they require long computational
times. Existing methods require many evaluations of the objective function,
which in this case are the simulations. Booker proposes using surrogate models
to approximate the objective functions.  However, his proposal relies on a
specific class of direct search methods, the pattern search methods.




If the optimization method considers an infeasible x, i.e., an x that does not
satisfy the constraints, do not evaluate it.
