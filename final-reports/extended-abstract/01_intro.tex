\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

\todo{TRABALHAR NA INTRODUÇÃO - Focus right on the solution of complex problems, involving expensive evaluation functions}

	Environmental and economic concerns are forcing the architectural practice to carefully balance, in building design, the energy, lighting, structural, and cost factors, among others, seeking for more efficient design solutions, a methodology named \ac{PBD}. \ac{PBD} benefits both from \ac{AD} methodologies, because these offer architects the ability to explore larger design spaces, and simulations tools, because these allow them to analyze the different design solutions within that space. Finally, in order to find the best performing solutions, optimization techniques are required. 

	The combination of \ac{AD}, simulation, and optimization yields great potential for architectural practice. Firstly, it allows for the discovery of more efficient design variations. Secondly, it enables more informed design processes, as the architect can visualize and influence the optimization process. Finally, it can uncover unexpected designs that, despite belonging to the design space, were not previously considered.

	Despite its benefits, optimization is rarely sought due to the associated limitations, including (1) the difficulties in defining the optimization problem, (2) the need for high expertise to select and fine-tune the optimization algorithms, (3) the complexity of the existing optimization tools, as well as (4) the long computation time of the optimization process \cite{Attia2013,Nguyen2014}. Furthermore, the lack of confidence in the optimization process and the idea that it is a completely automated process often leads to the perception of optimization as a restrictive process that hinders the architect’s creativity and expressiveness.

\subsection{Algorithmic Design}
	The implementation of changes to a design should be simplified, and, in fact, one way of speeding up design changes is to use parametric models. These models have parameters representing degrees of freedom in the design, which the architect is willing to manipulate in the search for a better performing design. A particularly good approach to produce parametric models is through \ac{AD} \cite{Terzidis2006}. Here, instead of directly creating a 3D model in a \ac{CAD} or \ac{BIM} tool, the architect creates a program that can be executed with different values of its parameters to produce the corresponding 3D models. This considerably improves the implementation of design changes, allowing a broader exploration of the design space.

\subsection{Algorithmic Analysis}
	Similarly to \ac{AD}, in \ac{AA}, the analytical model is produced by an algorithm, instead of being created by hand or relying on fragile conversion tools. The novelty is that this algorithm is the same that is used for \ac{AD}, but configured differently, so as to match the requirements of the analysis tools being used. For example, for lighting analysis tools, a truss might be represented by its surfaces, while for structural analysis tools, it might be represented by a graph of nodes and edges. In either case, the same algorithm is capable of generating different models for different types of analysis.

	Moreover, \ac{AA} is also concerned with the automation of the whole analysis process. In practice, this means that not only is the generation of the analytical model automated, but so is the setup of the analysis tool and the collection of its results.

\subsection{Goals}

The main goal of this dissertation is to identify the most efficient optimization algorithms for the different performance optimization problems that occur in building design and that frequently involve computationally heavy evaluation functions. Moreover, this dissertation aims to encapsulate these algorithms in an optimization framework that simplifies their application and, thus, promotes design optimization in architecture. Finally, we evaluate the proposed framework in the architectural practice and we study the behavior of different algorithms in various real \ac{BPO} problems, including the optimization of simulation-based lighting, structural, and cost aspects of buildings.
