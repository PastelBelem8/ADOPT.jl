The building sector currently presents one of the largest economic and environmental footprints. Optimization can minimize this impact by finding more efficient building variants, prior to their construction. Building design optimization spurs the exploration of (1) algorithmic approaches, to generate multiple design variants, (2) simulation tools, to evaluate design's performance regarding distinct aspects (e.g., acoustics, thermal, structural, costs), and (3) optimization algorithms, to seek more efficient design variants. Unfortunately, despite the existence of several optimization algorithms, their application to architectural optimization problems is not well-studied and the lack of experience/knowledge often drive architects towards the application of the simplest available algorithm. However, this algorithm is rarely the most efficient option for addressing a specific problem, often struggling to find more efficient designs or comprising a time-consuming process. A poor algorithm selection can even have more dramatic effects when considering the optimization of multiple conflicting design aspects simultaneously. 

This dissertation studies optimization algorithms specifically tailored for addressing simulation-based optimization problems. In particular, we develop an optimization framework that incorporates different optimization approaches and algorithms. We evaluate the framework in the context of three architectural case studies. Obtained results reveal the performance impacts associated with a pondered choice of an algorithm for a specific problem. Moreover, results corroborate the idea that different optimization algorithms should be tested in order to determine the one that better fits the problem to address.
