This chapter focuses on the evaluation of the proposed framework, from different perspectives, which include the diversity of the algorithms currently supported by the solution's prototype, their performance, and the visual mechanisms. To this end, we divide the evaluation in two phases: in \Cref{sec:qualitative}, we discuss the qualitative properties of the current prototype, outlining the flexibility and heterogeneity of the provided algorithms, while in \Cref{sec:quantitative}, we assess the viability of the current prototype in the architectural practice by using it to address three real case studies. These case studies corroborate the suitability of the algorithmic framework described in\Cref{chap:implement}, by using the optimizer prototype and the Khepri \ac{AD} tool to enable the application of different optimization algorithms. 

Overall, this evaluation aims to answer the following questions: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Do the studied algorithms present benefits for the architectural practice? Particularly, are they able to reduce the impact of the expensive performance analysis that are typically employed in building design?
	\item Is there any algorithm or class of algorithms that constantly outperforms others?
	\item Is there any difference between different \ac{MOO} approaches?
	\item Is the proposed framework applicable to the architectural practice? 
	\item ...\todo{Melhorar estas research paths...}
\end{itemize}

\section{Qualitative Evaluation}
\label{sec:qualitative}

The quantitative evaluation of optimization frameworks involve considering multiple aspects, including the flexibility, adaptability, diversity of algorithms, ease of use, among others. Calling upon the \acp{NFLT} discussed in \Cref{ssec:comparisondfo}, some algorithms are really good solvers for some problems and very poor solvers for others~\cite{Wolpert1997NFLT}. Selecting the right algorithm can have a great impact in the efficiency of optimization processes. Particularly, in building design, to benefit from such performance gains, diversity of algorithms allows to face each problems' characteristics differently, enabling the identification of most promising algorithms. In addition to the algorithms' diversity, in order to be easily used by less experienced users, algorithms should be effortlessly run, without the need for many manual changes. Notwithstanding their innate simplicity, optimization frameworks should also be flexible enough to enable more experienced users to fine-tune them according to their expertise, thus fostering more efficient optimization processes. At last, a good framework should adapt to handle different problems.

Regarding the adaptability of the current prototype, it provides mechanisms to address both single- and multi-objective problems: 15 \ac{SOO} algorithms and 13 \acp{MOEA}, respectively. Simpler approaches, like the design of experiments approach discussed in \Cref{ssec:doe}, are also possible using one of the 5 sampling methods available in the prototype. Moreover, a crucial features of this prototype is that it provides 10 \ac{ML} algorithms to be used with other techniques, thus allowing to reduce the time complexity involved in building design. 

\todo{Tabela / Imagem - discriminativa sobre os tipos de algoritmos e as classes}

\todo{Table X} presents a view of the algorithms supported by the prototype discriminated by class and domain. When comparing to currently existing tools in architecture, our solution presents a more extense and diverse set of algorithms, which can be explored to address a wider variety of problems. Moreover, while the existing tools rely on a unique optimization approach (e.g., \ac{SOO}, or Pareto-based optimization), our solution adapts to the user needs, providing the necessary mechanisms to the different approaches.

Unlike existing tools, which are implemented on top of visual programming languages, like Grasshopper and Dynamo, the prototype is implemented on top of a textual programming language. Although the graphical feel of the visual programming paradigm provides a more comfortable experience to less experienced users, the fact that the prototype makes use of the textual paradigm confers more scalability and portability to the achieved designs, thus allowing users to seamless apply optimization to more complex buildings. Nevertheless, to make it more appealing to less experienced users, the prototype includes a ready-to-use format, where every algorithm is configured by default.  

Besides the ready-to-use format, the prototype supports finer configurations of the different algorithms, thus allowing more experienced users to employ their knowledge to fine-tune and, if desired, to conjugante different algorithms. 

Moreover, given the importance of testing different algorithms before settling for a single one~\cite{Wortmann2016BBO}, the prototype provides the necessary mechanisms to facilitate and automate testing multiple algorithms with no additional efforts for the user. Conversely, existing architectural tools require the user's intervention in order to test different algorithms, eitherr by dragging other optimizer components and making necessary changes in the design script (e.g., ) or, when possible, by simply re-configuring the optimization tool to use one of the other supported algorithms. 

Regarding the post-processing and logging mechanisms, the proposed prototype is automatically configured to produce extensive log files, including all the information about the algorithms and problems being addressed, as well as a real-time log of the different solutions explored during the optimization run. This differs from existing tools, which only made the log files available in the end of the run. That being said, some of the currently existing tools still outperform the proposed prototype in terms of the visualization and interactivity features. The proposed prototype provides visual interactive Python scripts that read the log files and produce the corresponding plots. However, this plots are not updated in real time, instead requiring the user to re-run the script.

\section{Quantitative Evaluation}
\label{sec:quantitative}

In order to study and explore the behavior of algorithms within building design domains, we evaluate the performance of different algorithms using the optimizer prototype,  discussed in \Cref{chap:implement}, to assess their performance in the context of building design problems. Initially, we consider the optimization of the daylighting conditions of a solarium in an Ericeira house. Subsequently, we consider the evaluation of an arts exhibition pavillion involving two distinct components: an arc-shaped space frame structure and an interior gallery. These components involved the optimization of two simultaneously conflicting aspects, thus enabling a more comprehensive study about the performance of different \acp{MOOA}.

\end{figure}

The first case study involves the optimization of the lighting conditions of a room in an isolated private house in Portugal. The room was designed with a set of façade shading panels that modulates the daylight conditions on the interior. Depicted in \Cref{fig:ericeira_panels_explanation}, the panels are composed of a set of horizontal wood bars of different sizes, which alternate between one full-length bar and a set of smaller bars. The size and the position of the smaller bars along the panel's width are randomized for aesthetics reasons. In the end, the problem is defined in terms of four variables: the minimum and maximum lengths of smaller bars, the length’s step, and the maximum distance separating two consecutive bars. The different design variations were evaluated with regards to their daylight conditions, measured in terms of the \ac{sUDI} \todo{Nabiland Mardaljevic 2006}. \Cref{fig:ericeira_multiple_panels} represents some variations of our case study with different \ac{sUDI} values.

	\label{fig:ericeira_multiple_panels}
\end{figure}


For this particular problem we subdivided the tests in two phases: (1) we compared both global and local model methods’ performance; and (2) we analyzed the impact of the starting point’s choice in theoverall performance of local methods. The impact of the starting point was tested by providing each algorithm with two initial guesses: both a good and a bad solution, i.e., with values of sUDI of 78\% and 7\%, respectively.
