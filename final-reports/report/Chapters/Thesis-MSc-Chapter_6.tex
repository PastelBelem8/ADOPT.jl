\section{Limitations and Future Work}

This dissertation proposes a general-purpose optimization framework providing different optimization approaches and optimization algorithms particularly tailored for optimization problems including simulation-based objective functions. Although the current framework already proved valuable to address architectural problems, it can be further improved. In this section, we describe the limitations of the current framework and we suggest future lines of research.

% System Limitations
\subsection{Limitations}

Despite providing the base functionality for addressing several optimization problems, the current solution still presents some limitations which will be emphasized in this section. When considering the key aspects mentioned in \cref{ssec:AOW}, it is possible to identify a few limitations, namely in terms of (1) the flexibility/automation of specific optimization approaches, (2) interactivity, and, also, (3) the visualization capabilities.
% In  we mentioned the four key aspects of optimization within architectural workflows. 

Firstly, notwithstanding its different optimization mechanisms to support different optimization approaches (e.g., design of experiments, \ac{SOO}, pareto-based), users could also benefit from other optimization approaches, like the prioritization of the optimization of different objectives (e.g., in a bi-objective optimization problem, the user can optimize one objective first and only then proceed to optimize the second). 

Secondly, the current framework does provide the mechanisms to follow a human-in-the-loop approach, where the user is able to interact and influence the optimization process. The ability to influence the course of an optimization approach would be particularly interesting in the architectural field, where users can use recently acquired knowledge or intuitions to explore more promising regions of the design space or even to speed-up the optimization process. A possible research path is to investigate the ability to change or add constraints in real time or to specify different design variants to be explored and generalize other similar design variants from the selected design variants.

Finally, although the current visualization mechanisms provide a fair and general understanding of the results obtained in optimization processes, these present some limitations concerning the visualization of Pareto fronts for problems involving more than three objectives. An important research path is how to represent the information regarding different runs of \ac{MOO} algorithms, for which users have a limited evaluation budget and cannot afford to let the algorithms run indefinitely until they converge towards an idyllic Pareto Front. During this dissertation, we adopted a combination of a table comprised of the mean values for the Pareto fronts of different runs. \todo{Referenciar trabalho do Edward Tufte?} 

% One other important research path is to implement a real time implementation does not provide real-time updating mechanisms. optimization framework does not provide an integrated real-time the visual mechanisms is not being updated in real-time which is a limitation. Although we have 

\subsection{Future Work}
% Case studies
The developed framework was tested in a single-objective daylight optimization case study and two bi-objective optimization case studies, one involving the optimization of structural and aesthetics aspects and other involving the optimization of daylight and cost aspects. All three case studies involved the optimization of less than six variables, at most two objectives, and no constraints. In the future, the proposed framework could be used to test optimization problems with higher complexity, not only in terms of variables and objectives, but also by adding constraints. Moreover, it would be interesting to assess the performance of optimization algorithms when subject to optimization problems involving different design aspects, including, among others, thermal, energy consumption, and acoustics. 
 
% Optimization algorithms
One other relevant research path is the evaluation of more optimization algorithms, involving different mechanisms and strategies, in order to assess their suitability for optimization problems and its impact on the overall performance of optimization processes. Additionally, as it has been partially demonstrated with the Ericeira's case study, fine-tuning and providing initial information to certain algorithms may drastically improve their performance. For this reason, evaluating the impact of different algorithm's parameters for certain optimization problems would be another relevant case study, particularly, for complex building design problems involving expensive evaluation functions. 

Furthermore, it would be interesting to study the impact of pre-training surrogate-based optimization models based on data obtained from standard optimization test functions \todo{ZDT ou DEB ref...}. Particularly, users could use previous knowledge about the objectives' behavior (e.g., discontinuous, multimodal, convex) and pre-train the surrogate models in similar standardized test functions, thus, potentially, accelerating optimization processes. %An ensemble of algorithms could be exploited to maxmize the efficiency of these processes.

% - Surrogate modeling test the impact of using one surrogate model to each objective vs using one to all objectives

% Interesting future work
Finally, currently available optimization tools rarely provide any information regarding the optimization results, which difficults users' ability to understand the results. An interesting research path is to explore mechanisms that provide an explanation regarding the quality of the obtained results, especially when using opaque algorithms, i.e., whose non-linearity severely hinders the inteligibility of the optimization process itself. Recent advances in the field of \ac{ML} related to the models' explainability are promising and can be explored to provide explanations about the different optimization algorithms.
