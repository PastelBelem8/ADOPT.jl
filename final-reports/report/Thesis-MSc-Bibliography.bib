Furthermore, the problem is dynamic as patient arrival and treatment$\backslash$r$\backslash$n processes are stochastic. In this paper we present a strategy optimization approach where the parameters of different strategies$\backslash$r$\backslash$n are optimized using a multiobjective EDA. The strategies were designed such that they enable dynamic resource allocation with$\backslash$r$\backslash$n an offline EDA. Also, the solutions are understandable to health care professionals. We show that these techniques can be$\backslash$r$\backslash$n applied to this real-world problem. The results are compared to allocation strategies used in hospital practice.},
